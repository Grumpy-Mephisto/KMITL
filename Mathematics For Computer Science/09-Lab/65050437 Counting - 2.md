# Probability of a case select middle value from 3 values

In this example, we will count the number of ways to select a middle value from 3 values. We will use the following notation:

You can random the value of $x$ from 1 to 3. The probability of $x$ is $1/3$.

All result in random 3 values is (Assume L is the lowest value, M is the middle value, H is the highest value):

```md
[L, L, L] = L
[L, L, M] = L
[L, L, H] = L
[L, M, L] = M ✅
[L, M, M] = M ✅
[L, M, H] = M ✅
[L, H, L] = H
[L, H, M] = H
[L, H, H] = H
[M, L, L] = L
[M, L, M] = L
[M, L, H] = L
[M, M, L] = M ✅
[M, M, M] = M ✅
[M, M, H] = M ✅
[M, H, L] = H
[M, H, M] = H
[M, H, H] = H
[H, L, L] = L
[H, L, M] = L
[H, L, H] = L
[H, M, L] = M ✅
[H, M, M] = M ✅
[H, M, H] = M ✅
[H, H, L] = H
[H, H, M] = H
[H, H, H] = H

And Probability of getting a reference from the middle is 13/27
