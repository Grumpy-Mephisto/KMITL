getCoefficients prompts the user to input the coefficients (A, B, C) for the quadratic equation

calculateDiscriminant calculates the discriminant of a quadratic equation using the formula 'b^2 - 4ac'
based on the provided coefficients A, B, and C. The computed discriminant is essential to determine the
nature of the roots of the equation. The function returns the discriminant as a float64 value. If the leading
coefficient 'A' is zero, the function prints an error message stating "A cannot be 0" and returns a value of 0
as the discriminant, since the equation would not represent a quadratic equation without a squared term.

calculateRoots determines the roots of a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
(-b Â± sqrt(discriminant)) / (2a). It takes the provided discriminant to check whether the equation
has real roots and calculates them accordingly, assuming the discriminant is not negative. The function
returns two float64 values representing the two roots of the quadratic equation. If the discriminant is
negative, meaning the equation has complex roots, these will not be calculated by this function.

printResults displays the calculated roots of the quadratic equation. It receives two float64 values
